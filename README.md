FAST-SC-DLL-OC3Hywind
=====================
FAST-SC for OC3Hywind (Bladed DLL Controller)

FAST-SC is a modified version of the NREL code FAST (http://wind.nrel.gov/designcodes/simulators/fast/), and was developed by Dr. Matthew Lackner at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2009 and modified through 2013. FAST-SC was created in order to model additional degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) in wind turbines, specifically structural control devices (the “SC” stands for “structural control”).  More information: http://www.umass.edu/windenergy/research.topics.tools.software.fastsc.php

The source files are based on FAST_v7.01.00a-bjj amd Dr. Lackner's modification.

This solution is built with IDE "Microsoft Visual Studio 2010" and Fortran Compiler from "Intel Parallel Studio XE 2013".
